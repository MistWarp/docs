# renderer.draw()

Manually triggers a render of the stage.

## Syntax

```javascript
renderer.draw()
```

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

**Type:** `void`

## Notes

The renderer usually handles drawing automatically. You rarely need to call this manually unless you are doing custom off-screen rendering or need to force an update immediately after a change.
