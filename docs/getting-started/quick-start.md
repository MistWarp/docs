# Quick Start Guide

Get started with MistWarp in minutes! This guide will help you create your first project and understand the key differences from Scratch.

## Creating Your First Project

1. **Open MistWarp** - Navigate to [warp.mistium.com](https://warp.mistium.com/)
2. **Familiarize yourself** - The interface is similar to Scratch with some enhancements
3. **Start Creating** - Begin adding sprites and blocks just like in Scratch

## Key Differences from Scratch

### 🚀 Enhanced Performance
- Projects run faster thanks to the optimized compiler
- Supports higher frame rates (up to 60+ FPS)
- Improved rendering for smoother animations

### 🎨 Customization Options
- **Dark Mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes
- **Custom Themes** - Create and apply your own visual themes
- **Stage Sizing** - Customize stage dimensions beyond the standard 480x360

### 🔧 Developer Features
- **Browser Console Access** - Use `window.vm` to access the virtual machine
- **Advanced Extensions** - Create custom blocks with JavaScript
- **Performance Profiling** - Monitor and optimize project performance

### 💻 Default Sprite
- MistWarp uses **Misty** as the default sprite instead of Scratch Cat
- All Scratch sprites are still available in the sprite library

## Your First MistWarp Project

Let's create a simple project to get familiar with MistWarp:

### Step 1: Add a Sprite
1. Click the **Choose a Sprite** button in the bottom right
2. Select any sprite from the library
3. The sprite appears on the stage

### Step 2: Add Some Code
1. Drag a `when green flag clicked` block from the Events category
2. Add a `say Hello! for 2 seconds` block from the Looks category
3. Add a `move 10 steps` block from the Motion category
4. Add a `forever` block to make it repeat

### Step 3: Run Your Project
1. Click the **Green Flag** above the stage
2. Watch your sprite move and talk!

## Exploring Advanced Features

### Using the Compiler
MistWarp automatically compiles your blocks into JavaScript for faster execution. You can:
- View compiled code in the browser console
- Profile performance to find bottlenecks
- Optimize your project based on insights

### Custom Extensions
Create custom blocks with JavaScript:
1. Open the **Extensions** menu
2. Browse available extensions
3. Load custom extensions from URLs
4. Access advanced APIs not available in standard Scratch

### Saving and Sharing

**Save Locally:**
- File → Save to your computer
- Projects save as `.sb3` files compatible with Scratch

**Save to Cloud:**
- Create an account to save projects online
- Access your projects from any device
- Share project links with others

## Common Tasks

### Importing Scratch Projects
1. Download your `.sb3` file from Scratch
2. In MistWarp: File → Load from your computer
3. Select the `.sb3` file
4. Your project loads with all sprites and code intact

### Changing Themes

2. Select **Theme** from the dropdown
3. Choose from available themes or create your own

### Adjusting Performance
1. Access **Advanced Settings** from the menu
2. Adjust frame rate (30 FPS or 60 FPS)
3. Enable/disable compiler for compatibility testing
4. Configure stage size and rendering options
